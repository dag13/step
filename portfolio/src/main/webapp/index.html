      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <p><u>Text Prediction Algorithm</u>  Date: April 2019
      <br>Written in C, this algorithm utilizes the trie data structure for efficient text 
          prediction as well as fast insertion and search of words.

      <p><u>Lonely Party Arrays</u> Date: March 2019
      <br>An advanced data structure written in Java that automatically allocates and deallocates

      <p><u>Mini Processor Simulator</u> Date: February 2019
      <br>Simulates a MIPS proccessor by displaying the principle of data paths and control signals
          of a MIPS processor. This was a group project in which we decided to split up the 
          development of the processor. In addition to being responsible for a portion of 
          development I was soley responsible for testing our simulator.
